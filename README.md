# BeanBattle

![](Assets/Art/Images/MainMenuBackground.png)

 
This is Bean Battle, a **Very** simple (probably) unfinished X-Com like game, just to try out different styles and Mechanics. 
It's more to be seen as a learning and testing Project than a finished game.
In its current state it needs to be played as a Hotseat multiplayer
